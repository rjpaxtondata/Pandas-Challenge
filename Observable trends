The data helped to paint a clear picture that school size is an essential indicator of school success. Other factors that may be perceived as important (e.g., Total School Budget and Per Student Budget) were not essential indicators. For example, despite evidence that Cabrera High School only spent $582.00 per student (i.e., Per Student Budget), it was associated with the best overall passing score.  The results were evident in the main table and the table created to identify different spending bins. However, there does appear to be a 'sweet spot.'  Schools with < 1500 students did not appear to perform better than schools with 1500 to < 2000 students.  Therefore, a key tipping point could be with a population of < 2000 students. 
The data also suggest that charter schools may perform better than district schools, as indicated in the Top Performing Schools table. Although there is no additional data that describes the student population (i.e., the percentage of students who qualify for free or reduced-price lunch or percent minority) or teacher pay, the activity leads us to believe that charter schools spend less money but perform better than district schools.
